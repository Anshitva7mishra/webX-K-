# 🌐Local Business Static Website (React.js)

## 📌 Project Overview
Small local businesses often rely heavily on walk-in customers and word-of-mouth promotion. Due to the absence of an online presence, potential customers struggle to find accurate information about services, location, or contact details. This limits the business’s reach, credibility, and growth in today’s digital environment, especially for customers searching for nearby shops and services in their local area.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a **professional, responsive, and static website using React.js** that serves as a digital identity for a local business.
